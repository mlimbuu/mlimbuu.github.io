Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My research interests are machine learning and reinforcement learning on graphs for multi-agents. My current research is focused on developing algorithmns to optimize strategic coordination/cooperation among goal oriented multi- agents using graph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement Learning. I’m also interested in improving generalization and sample efficiency of learning agents, with focus on transfer learning and meta learning to optimize agents adaptibility to new tasks and environments.

I'm Computer Science PhD Student at George Mason University, where I'm advised by [Prof. Dr Xuesu Xiao](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/) at [Robotixx Lab (https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/RobotiXX/lab.html) and [Prof. Dr Daigo Shishika](https://shishika.com) at [CRADL Lab](https://www.shishika.com). My research focuses on multi-agent decision-making under adversarial uncertainty, with an emphasis on team coordination, cooperation, and role allocation. I study how teams of goal-driven agents can anticipate changing conditions and coordinate effectively in non-stationary environments. My work is motivated by safety-critical applications including robotic teams, autonomous navigation, and defense-oriented coordination problems, where reliable cooperation under uncertainty is essential and robustness and interpretability are as important as performance.

Previously, I worked at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com/) as Software/DevOps Engineer. I completed my BS in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal and MS in Computer Science from George Mason University.
